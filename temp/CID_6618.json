The animals were housed in metabolism cages. Urine and fecal samples were collected throughout the 72-hour study. Sixteen blood samples per animal were collected from the tail vein; sampling time was not reported. At 1, 4, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours after exposure 4 animals from each dose group were decapitated and tissues (liver, kidneys, spleen, brain, fat, muscles, adrenals and sciatic nerve) were extracted. The amount of (14)C in the red blood cells, plasma, feces, tissue extracts and urine was determined. Samples of feces collected over the first 48 hours were analysed and metabolites were identified via gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. At 24, 48 and 72 hours, the /researchers/ report the fate of the radioactivity in urine, faeces and various tissues at both dose levels (results from 4 rats/timepoint). Irrespective of dose, the majority of the radioactivity detected was found in the feces. At 24 hours, 37 + or - 34% and 25 + or - 24% of administered radioactivity was eliminated in feces in the 250 and 1,000 mg/kg groups, respectively; at 48 hours, 61 + or - 25% and 43 + or - 19% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated, respectively; and at 72 hours, 65 + or - 24% and 51 + or - 17% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated, respectively. The urine represented a minor route of excretion; for both doses approximately 0.3% of the administered radioactivity was eliminated by this route by 72 hours. Radioactivity in the blood of the 250 mg/kg animals was reported to be 1.8 0.3%, 4 + or - 0.4% and 3.8 + or - 0.7% at 24, 48 and 72 hours, respectively (it was not determined in the 1,000 mg/kg group). At 72 hours, post-administration there was some retention in fat (approximately 3-6%) and muscle (approximately 11-14%); the deposition of (14)C within the tissues did not appear to be dose-dependent. However, it is documented by the authors of the study that possible errors exist in these calculations, the nature of which were not described. Thus, the calculations of the amount of (14)C in the tissues may be inaccurate. Furthermore, other studies have demonstrated very little retention of TBBP-A in the fat or other body tissue, therefore, the potential for bioaccumulation is not considered to be significant. It should also be noted that radioactivity levels were not detected in the digestive tract, intestinal contents, skin, bone and ligaments amongst others. The authors present graphically radioactivity levels in plasma and red blood cells from the 250 mg/kg group only; in neither case are figures presented as a proportion of the administered dose. Qualitatively, the maximum level of radioactivity in plasma was observed within the first hour following administration; the subsequent decline of radioactivity followed a biphasic profile. The authors calculated half-lives of 0.9 and 230 hours for phase I and II, respectively. In red blood cells, the maximum level of radioactivity was observed 48 hours post-administration; it declined with a monophasic profile and a calculated half-life of 142 hours. At 72 hours post-administration, radioactivity levels in red blood cells were reported to be 10 times higher than those in plasma, however, it is unclear what the relative significance of this is without more quantitative information. Elevated levels were still reported at 10, 15 and 21 days post-administration, but again, the quantitative significance of these findings is unclear. The yield of (14)C-TBBP-A and/or metabolites extracted from the faeces of animals dosed with 250 mg/kg was approximately 89% of the radiolabel present in the faeces. Gas chromatography of the extract produced two peaks on the chromatogram, which mass spectral analysis identified as tribromobisphenol-A and unchanged TBBP-A. Quantitatively these two substances were present in the faeces in a ratio of approximately 1:9. From the results of this study, it is apparent that, irrespective of the dose, following intraperitoneal administration, the majority of TBBP-A is excreted in the feces, apparently unchanged. The elimination follows a similar time course to that reported following oral administration."

                "StringValue": "Ten female Sprague-Dawley rats received a single gavage dose of (14)C labelled TBBP-A in corn oil (average dose 7 mg/kg) (the position of the label was not stated). Urine and feces were collected separately at 4 and 8 hours in two animals (group I); at 4, 8, 16 and 24 hours in two animals (group II); and at 4, 8, 16, 24, 48 and 72 hours in two animals (group III). Blood samples were collected from a further four animals (group IV): from two animals at 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours after dosing and two animals at 16 hours after dosing. Animals in groups I, II, III were sacrificed at 8, 24 and 72 hours post dosing, respectively. The liver, kidney, brain, muscle, fat, spleen, skin and gonads were excised for assessment of radioactivity. Liquid scintillation counting was used for all quantitative measurements of radioactivity. In group I animals very little radioactivity was excreted in the urine or feces in the time periods 0-4 hours (0.03 and 0.0015% of the administered radioactivity, respectively) and 4-8 hours (0.02 and 0.0015% of administered radioactivity, respectively). Analysis of the tissues following sacrifice at 8 hours post-dosing revealed only a further 0.725% of the administered radioactivity, the highest levels being found in the liver (0.4%), muscle (0.12%), skin (0.12%) and fat (0.7%). Thus, analysis of the selected tissues and excreta accounted for less than 1% of the administered radioactivity after 8 hours. In group II animals, similar excretion of radioactivity in urine and feces to that reported in group I was observed for the time periods 0-4 hours (0.04 and 0.002% of administered radioactivity, respectively) and 4-8 hours (0.04 and 0.003% of administered radioactivity, respectively). Between 8-16 hours post-dosing, 0.12 and 26% of administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and feces, respectively, while in the time period 16-24 hours, 0.15 and 7.4% of administered radioactivity was excreted in urine and feces, respectively. Analysis of the tissues following sacrifice at 24 hours post-dosing revealed only a further 0.85% of the administered radioactivity, the highest levels being found in the liver (0.33), skin (0.18%), muscle (0.16%) and fat (0.16%). Thus, analysis of the selected tissues and excreta accounted for approximately 35% of the administered radioactivity after 24 hours. In group III animals a similar urinary excretion profile to that reported in groups I and II was observed, with levels gradually increasing over time (0.05, 0.09, 0.12, 0.15, 0.3 and 0.32% of administered radioactivity in time periods 0-4, 4-8, 8-16, 16-24, 24-48 and 48-72 hours, respectively). A slightly different fecal excretion profile was reported in these animals with the majority of the administered radioactivity being excreted between 16-48 hours (0.0015, 0.15, 7.5, 49.6, 36.3 and 1.5% of administered radioactivity in time periods 0-4, 4-8, 8-16, 16-24, 24-48 and 48-72 hours, respectively). Analysis of the tissues following sacrifice at 72 hours post-dosing revealed a further 0.2% of administered radioactivity (this excludes values for skin, as the skin of one animal was contaminated, the individual values reported were 4.7 and 0.13% of administered radioactivity). Thus, analysis of the selected tissues (excluding skin) and excreta accounted for approximately 96% of the administered radioactivity after 72 hours. Only relatively small amounts of radioactivity, of a similar magnitude, were measured in the blood of a separate group of animals at various time points (0.03, 0.03, 0.02, 0.01 and 0.01% of the administered radioactivity, at 4, 8, 16, 24 and 48 hours, respectively). The half-life in the blood was calculated ... to be approximately 20 hours. The maximum half-life of radioactivity in any tissue was estimated to be 71 hours (for fat). The findings of this study show that following oral administration, the majority of radio labelled TBBP-A and/or its metabolites were excreted in the feces within 72 hours. There was limited systemic distribution to the blood (from 4 hr onwards) and to those tissues that were analysed (from 8 hours onwards). Given the fecal excretion profile observed, the fact that the transit time in the gastrointestinal tract of a rat is 12 hours and the biliary excretion data from a previous study, it would be expected that the TBBP-A administered in this study would have been absorbed before being excreted via the bile and/or feces. There is no information regarding the \"missing\" radioactivity in animals sacrificed at 8 hours (&gt; 99% of the administered dose) and 24 hours (approximately 65% of the administered dose). A possible explanation is that it is in the gastrointestinal tract. Another possibility is that it is undergoing enterohepatic circulation; however, if this were the case it may be expected that a larger level of radioactivity would be found in the liver. It is also possible that TBBP-A is present in other tissues not analysed in this study. The earliest time point for which distribution data is available is 4 hours in blood; prior to this there is no information on the whereabouts of TBBP-A, and no significant radioactivity is detected until the 8-16-hour time period in the faeces. Thus, there is uncertainty concerning the fate of TBBP-A prior to its appearance in feces."

Environmental and human levels of PBDEs have been increasing in the past 30 years, but the toxicity of PBDEs is not fully understood. Studies on their effects are relatively limited, and show that PBDEs are neurotoxins and potential endocrine disrupters. Hydroxylated (OH) and methoxylated (MeO) PBDEs have also been reported in the adipose tissue, blood and milk of wild animals and humans. In the present study, 15 PBDE metabolites, two BDE mixtures (DE71 and DE79), and TBBPA were studied individually to determine their effects on ten steroidogenic genes, aromatase activity, and concentrations of two steroid hormones (<a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-6013\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/testosterone\">testosterone</a> and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5757\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/17beta-estradiol\">17beta-estradiol</a>) in the H295R human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line. Exposure to 0.05 uM 2'-OH-BDE-68 significantly induced the expression of CYP11A, CYP11B2, CYP17, CYP21, 3betaHSD2, 17betaHSD1, and 17betaHSD4, and the expression of StAR was induced by 6-OH-BDE-90 at the three exposure concentrations. Exposure to DE71 and DE79 resulted in dose-dependent trend towards induction, but these effects were not significant. Exposure to 0.5 uM 2-OH-BDE-123 and 2-MeO-BDE-123 resulted in significantly greater aromatase activity. However, none of the compounds affected sex hormone production at the concentrations tested. Generally, OH-BDEs had a much stronger ability to affect steroidogenic gene expression than MeO-BDEs."

Because these compounds have some structural resemblance to the thyroid hormone <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-853\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/thyroxine\">thyroxine</a> (T(4)), it was suggested that they may interfere with thyroid hormone metabolism and transport, e.g., by competition with T(4) on transthyretin (TTR). In the present study, we investigated the possible interaction of several brominated flame retardants with T(4) binding to TTR in an in vitro competitive binding assay, using human TTR and 125 I-T(4) as the displaceable radioligand. Compounds were tested in at least eight different concentrations ranging from 1.95 to 500 nM. In addition, we investigated the structural requirements of these and related ligands for competitive binding to TTR. /The investigators/ were able to show very potent competition binding for TBBPA and PBP (10.6- and 7.1-fold stronger than the natural ligand T(4), respectively). PBDEs were able to compete with T(4)-TTR binding only after metabolic conversion by induced rat liver microsomes, suggesting an important role for hydroxylation. Brominated bisphenols with a high degree of bromination appeared to be more efficient competitors, whereas chlorinated bisphenols were less potent compared to their brominated analogues. These results indicate that brominated flame retardants, especially the brominated phenols and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-6618\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/tetrabromobisphenol%20A\">tetrabromobisphenol A</a>, are very potent competitors for T(4) binding to human transthyretin in vitro and may have effects on thyroid hormone homeostasis in vivo comparable to the thyroid-disrupting effects of PCBs."

Other general indices such as the activity of gamma-glutamyltransferase, concentration of microsomal proteins and the level of cytochrome P450 did not show any significant changes. The most pronounced changes were noted with regard to indicators of porphyrogenic action. The results suggest that tetrabromobisphenol-A is capable of disturbing the heme metabolism in rats."

Half the rats in each dose group were sacrificed for a full gross necropsy and a histopathology on the organs and the tissues at 22 days of age and the remaining rats were reared without any treatment from post-weaning until 84 days of age to examine the recovery and the delayed occurrence of toxic effects. Treatment with 200 or 600 mg/kg TBBPA-induced nephrotoxicity characterized by the formation of polycystic lesions, and some deaths occurred in the 600 mg/kg group. There was no gender difference of nephrotoxicity and there were no other critical toxicities. At 85 days of age, nephrotoxic lesions were still present in the 200 and 600 mg/kg groups, but no abnormalities indicating delayed occurrence of toxic effects were found in the treated groups. In order to investigate the specificity of the nephrotoxicity induced by TBBPA in newborn rats, TBBPA was given to male and female young rats (5 weeks old) by oral administration at 0, 2000, or 6000 mg/kg per day for 18 days. The kidneys showed no histopathological changes even at the high dose. These results clearly indicate that the nephrotoxicity of TBBPA is specific for newborn rats although the toxic dose level was relatively high. To gain insight into the possible effects on human infants, the mechanism of this unexpected nephrotoxicity of TBBPA in newborn rats should be examined."

This design enables dose-response analysis and calculation of benchmark doses (BMDL). This reproduction study was preceded by a 28-day repeat dose subacute toxicity study, at 0-30-100-300 mkd. Major effects in the reproduction study included decreased circulating <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-853\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/thyroxine\">thyroxine</a> (T4) with BMDLs of 31 (m) and 16 (f) mkd, and increased weight of testis and male pituitary (BMDLs of 0.5 and 0.6 mkd). The hypothyroxinemia correlated to a cluster of developmental parameters including delayed sexual development in females, decreased pup mortality, and effects on brainstem auditory evoked potentials. A second cluster of parameters in F1 animals was correlated to increased testis weight, and included female gonad weight, endometrium height, CYP19/aromatase activity in the ovary, and plasma <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-6013\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/testosterone\">testosterone</a> levels in males. These two correlation clusters suggest a dual action of TBBPA. The only effects in the subacute study were decreased circulating T4 and increased T3 levels in males (BMDLs 48 and 124 mkd), and non-significant trends for these parameters in females, suggesting that the other effects in the reproduction study were induced during development. Combined with data of human exposure to environmental TBBPA, the margin of exposure for highly exposed populations can be calculated at 2.6, and current use of TBBPA may therefore be a matter of concern for human health."

Both 6-OH-BDE47 and 6-OH-BDE99 showed an inhibitory effect on aromatase activity at concentrations &gt;2.5 uM and &gt;5 uM, respectively.

Compared to 6-OH-BDE47, the methoxy analog (6-CH(3)O-BDE47) did not elicit a cytotoxic effect, whereas significant inhibition of aromatase remained. TBP caused a concentration-dependent induction of aromatase activity between 0.5 and 7.5 uM (with a maximum of 3.8-fold induction at 7.5 uM).

The exposure of hepatocytes to TBBPA caused not only concentration (0.25-1.0 mM)- and time- (0-3 h) dependent cell death accompanied by the loss of cellular <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-5957\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/ATP\">ATP</a>, adenine nucleotide pools, reduced glutathione, and protein thiols, but also the accumulation of oxidized glutathione and <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-10964\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/malondialdehyde\">malondialdehyde</a>, indicating lipid peroxidation.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between the degree of halogenation of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-6623\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/BPA\">BPA</a> analogues and their affinity and activity towards human PPARgamma and ERs and to characterize active metabolites of major marketed halogenated bisphenols. The biological activity of all compounds was studied using reporter cell lines expressing these nuclear receptors (NRs). /The researchers/ used NR-based affinity columns to rapidly evaluate the binding affinity of halogenated bisphenols for PPARgamma and ERs and to trap active metabolites of TBBPA and TCBPA formed in HepG2 cells. The agonistic potential of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-6623\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/BPA\">BPA</a> analogs highly depends on their halogenation degree: the bulkier halogenated <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-6623\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/BPA\">BPA</a> analogs, the greater their capability to activate PPARgamma. In addition, PPARgamma-based affinity column, HGELN-PPARgamma reporter cell line and crystallographic analysis clearly demonstrate that the sulfation pathway, usually considered as a detoxification process, leads for TBBPA and TCBPA, to the formation of <a class=\"pubchem-internal-link CID-1117\" href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sulfate\">sulfate</a> conjugates which possess a residual PPARgamma-binding activity. /The researchers/ results highlight the effectiveness NR-based affinity columns to trap and characterize biologically active compounds from complex matrices. Polyhalogenated bisphenols, but also some of their metabolites, are potential disrupters of PPARgamma activity."
